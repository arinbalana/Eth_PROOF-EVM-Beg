This Solidity program is a simple "Hello World" program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to get a feel for how it works.

Description 
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a single function that returns the string "Hello World!". This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/. Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file: javascript pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

        contract HelloWorld {
        function sayHello() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello World!";
         }
        }
-- Select the "Solidity Compiler" tab from the sidebar on the left to begin compiling the code. Click the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button after ensuring that the "Compiler" option is set to"0.8.4" (or another suitable version).

-- Selecting the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab from the left-hand sidebar will allow you to deploy the contract after the code has been compiled. From the dropdown menu, choose the "HelloWorld" contract, and then press the "Deploy" button.

-- You can communicate with the contract by using the sayHello method once it has been deployed. Select the "sayHello" function by clicking on it after selecting the "HelloWorld" contract in the left-hand sidebar. Lastly, to run the function and get the "Hello World!" message, click the "transact" button.
